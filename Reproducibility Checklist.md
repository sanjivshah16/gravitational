# Reproducibility Checklist

This checklist ensures that the MVP implementation can be reproduced reliably:

## Environment Setup
- [x] Python 3.8+ required
- [x] PyTorch 1.8+ required
- [x] Required packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, tqdm
- [x] No special hardware requirements (though GPU recommended for faster training)
- [x] Random seeds set for reproducibility (torch.manual_seed(42), np.random.seed(42))

## Code Structure
- [x] All model implementations are complete and self-contained
- [x] Data pipeline handles preprocessing consistently
- [x] Training script includes all necessary hyperparameters
- [x] Evaluation metrics are clearly defined and implemented
- [x] Analysis scripts generate consistent visualizations

## Running the Code
- [x] Main entry point: `run_experiment.py`
- [x] Results are saved to timestamped directories
- [x] Analysis can be run separately on saved results
- [x] All file paths are relative to project root
- [x] No hardcoded absolute paths

## Documentation
- [x] MVP report includes complete implementation details
- [x] Code is thoroughly commented
- [x] Function signatures include type hints and docstrings
- [x] Configuration options are documented
- [x] Expected outputs are described

## Validation
- [x] All scripts run without errors
- [x] Results are deterministic given fixed random seeds
- [x] Memory requirements are reasonable for MVP scale
- [x] Runtime is reasonable for MVP scale
- [x] All visualizations render correctly
