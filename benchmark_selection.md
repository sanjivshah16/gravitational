# Benchmark Selection for Attention Mechanism Comparison

## Requirements for Benchmark Selection

For effectively comparing different attention mechanisms (conventional, gravitational, multi-timescale, and combined), we need benchmarks that:

1. Test both short-range and long-range dependencies
2. Are standard in the field for evaluating attention mechanisms
3. Include tasks where temporal relationships matter
4. Are computationally feasible for an MVP implementation
5. Allow for clear performance differentiation between approaches

## Selected Benchmark: Long Range Arena (LRA)

The Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark suite is ideal for our comparison because:

1. **Specifically designed for long-range dependencies**: LRA was created to evaluate the ability of models to capture dependencies at varying distances, which is perfect for testing multi-timescale approaches.

2. **Multiple diverse tasks**: LRA includes several tasks that test different aspects of attention:
   - ListOps: Tests hierarchical structure understanding
   - Text Classification: Tests document-level understanding
   - Retrieval: Tests matching of long sequences
   - Image Classification (pixel-level): Tests spatial relationships
   - Pathfinder: Tests long-range spatial dependencies

3. **Standard in the field**: LRA is widely used to evaluate transformer variants and attention mechanisms, making results comparable to published literature.

4. **Varying sequence lengths**: Tasks range from moderate (~1K tokens) to very long sequences (~16K tokens), allowing us to test performance across different context lengths.

5. **Clear evaluation metrics**: Each task has established metrics (primarily accuracy), making comparison straightforward.

## Implementation Strategy

For our MVP, we will focus on two tasks from the LRA benchmark:

1. **Text Classification**: Using the IMDb reviews dataset with sequences truncated to 4,096 tokens. This tests the model's ability to understand sentiment across long documents.

2. **ListOps**: Mathematical operations on lists with deeply nested structures, testing hierarchical understanding with sequences of up to 2,048 tokens.

These two tasks provide a good balance of:
- Different types of dependencies (semantic vs. hierarchical)
- Reasonable computational requirements for an MVP
- Clear performance differentiation potential between attention mechanisms

## Data Characteristics

### Text Classification (IMDb)
- Binary sentiment classification (positive/negative)
- Average sequence length: ~300 tokens
- Maximum sequence length for test: 4,096 tokens
- Training set: 25,000 examples
- Test set: 25,000 examples
- For MVP: We'll use a subset of 5,000 training examples and 1,000 test examples

### ListOps
- 10-way classification problem
- Nested mathematical operations (e.g., MIN, MAX, MED, SUM_MOD)
- Sequence length: Up to 2,048 tokens
- Training set: ~96,000 examples
- Test set: ~4,000 examples
- For MVP: We'll use a subset of 10,000 training examples and 1,000 test examples

## Evaluation Metrics

We will use the following metrics to compare the four attention mechanisms:

1. **Accuracy**: Primary metric for both tasks
2. **Training and inference speed**: Measured in examples/second
3. **Memory usage**: Peak memory consumption during training and inference
4. **Convergence rate**: Number of epochs to reach 90% of maximum performance
5. **Attention pattern visualization**: Qualitative analysis of what each model attends to

This comprehensive evaluation will allow us to clearly demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of each attention mechanism across different types of tasks and sequence lengths.
